## Script kiddies: Source or come up with a text manipulation problem and solve it with at least two of awk, sed, tr and / or grep.

Created `sort.sh` file that reads input.txt file in the directory using `grep` , `sort` and `awk`.
- it splits text into array of lines
- sort the lines in alphavetical order
- join line array into a string
- echo the result to the console

## Script grown-ups: Solve the problem in question 3 using any programming language you like.

Created `sort.py` file  which is python script for sorting the `input.txt` file.
- read input text from file
- split input text into an array of lines
- sort lines in alphabetical order
- join line array into a string and prints.
